# Rollbar for Java and Android

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rollbar/rollbar-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rollbar/rollbar-java)

The current library has undergone a major overhaul between versions 0.5.4 and 1.0.0.
We recommend upgrading from prior versions of `rollbar-java`, but that process may require some
work on your end for the more complex use cases of the old library.

The code is documented with javadoc and therefore should be usable from viewing
the documentation in the source. There are examples in the `examples` directory showing different
use cases for consuming these libraries.

## Setup Instructions
1. [Sign up for a Rollbar account](https://rollbar.com/signup)
2. Follow the [Installation](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/java#section-installation) instructions in our [Java SDK docs](https://docs.rollbar.com/docs/java) to install rollbar-java and configure it for your platform.
